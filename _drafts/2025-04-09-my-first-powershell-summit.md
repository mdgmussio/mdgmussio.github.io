# My first time

Thursday, April 10th marked the end of the PowerShell Summit 2025. This was far different from any other technical conference I've attended, which is exactly the aim of this group.

First this "conference" is all about the community.  And that is made clear from the get go.  The Summitter guide is a document that outlines what you can expect, with a break down of each day.  There is a huge effort made to make everyone feel included and accepted.  There is a large attempt to make sure participants mingle, 'sit with a different group at each meal',  '[observe the pac-man rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/)', and after hour events specifically targeted at inspiring people to congergate and chat.

As we filtered into the room for the keyroom I was busy reading name tags, and my brain was racing as I was shocked to see names I sort of recongnized but couldn't quite put my finger on it. [Matthew Dowst](https://psweekly.dowst.dev/), [Jeff Hicks](https://jdhitsolutions.github.io/), [Justin Gtoe](https://justingrote.github.io/) and many others - And it took me a moment to realize these are all people I've followed online. The old adage of 'you should never meet your heros' does not apply to the PowerShell community. I had the great opportunity to meet and even chat with some of the legends of the PowerShell Community. And they did not disappoint. 

### Jeffrey Snover

I litterally got to meet the _**freaking**_ inventor of PowerShell.  Jeffrey gave a presentation to the entire conference on day two, where he shared some of the challanges of his career and of course PowerShell.

> "PowerShell is and always has been about you (the community) and helping you make more than those unix guys."

> -Jeffery Snover

As a college drop out Jeffrey's career is a fasinating tale, including holding over 30 patents and is a frequent industry speaker. He studied physics at the University of New Hampshire but did not graduate but later became a Microsoft Technical fellow.

previously a Microsoft Technical Fellow. He invented Windows PowerShell, a key automation and scripting tool, and served as Chief Architect for Windows Server and Azure Infrastructure. Before Microsoft, he worked at Tivoli Software, DEC, and startups, focusing on network and systems management. 

### Jeff Hicks & Don Gannon-Jones

Jeff and Don litterally wrote the book on PowerShell that lunched, I mean, 'launched; many journey into the world of PowerShell with 'Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches'.  

### Matthew Dowst

### Mike F. Robbins (Agent 47)

It's not often you get to rub shoulders with a famous hitman ðŸ¥·, and the person responsible for writing documentation you reference regularly, but hey, this is the PowerShell summit, anything is possible.  <img align="right" src="https://mikefrobbins.com/about/mikefrobbins-150x150.jpg" alt="Mike F.
